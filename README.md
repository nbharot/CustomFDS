## Get started

As said, what is proposed in this GitHub repository are micro-services. To get started, you will then be driven through some example usages of these micro-services. This is done through a Postman collection of API requests. All requests are extensively commented, and request/response examples are provided. Details about how to produce customized micro-services starting from the default implementations that are available in this repository are also given along the way. The Postman collection is available [online] (https://api.postman.com/collections/24980025-87630d52-c2fc-4b39-9b0d-a6492db54942?access_key=PMAT-01GQW2JF4H01QZFYRNDTQ6S0HA)
