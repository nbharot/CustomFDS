## Get started

As said, what is proposed in this GitHub repository are micro-services. To get started, you will then be driven through some example usages of these micro-services. This is done through a Postman collection of API requests. All requests are extensively commented, and request/response examples are provided. Details about how to produce customized micro-services starting from the default implementations that are available in this repository are also given along the way. The Postman collection is available [online] https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24980025/2s935hPSD8
