# CustomFDS
An API for Easy Learning
<hr>
 
This repository contains software artifacts and documentation related to CustomFDS. It allows easy access to Machine Learning Frameworks and allows user to customize Feature Selection, Sampling and Algorithm. It initially performs Mean Imputation and Min-Max Scaling. 

## Get started

As said, what is proposed in this GitHub repository are micro-services. To get started, you will then be driven through some example usages of these micro-services. This is done through a Postman collection of API requests. All requests are extensively commented, and request/response examples are provided. Details about how to produce customized micro-services starting from the default implementations that are available in this repository are also given along the way. The Postman collection is available [online] https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24980025/2s935hPSD8

In addition to the research, some contributions for open source are made available in the GitHub repository for practical purposes:
(i) a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation, named user guide.pptx, guides the user step-by-step through this demo; 
(ii) a preliminary release of the postman collection consisting of 9 API calls, aimed to fetch, train, preprocess , reduce and draw output from dataset.
